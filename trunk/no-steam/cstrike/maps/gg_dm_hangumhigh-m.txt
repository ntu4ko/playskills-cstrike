Halo's Capture the flag map is now a CSS
deathmatch map!

There are some changes to the size of the 
map, this is due to the difference in POV 
and jumping distances in CSS.

And what are those big orange things?
Go have a look!

--------------------

key to victory:
Avoid the open areas by using the big blocks!
